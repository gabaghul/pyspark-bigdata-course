# Joining and Appending DataFrames in PySpark

In this lecture we will be reviewing the foundational concepts of joinings and appending dataframes as well as the necessary PySpark calls to accomplish these tasks. Many of you may already be familiar with the common join types we will review here, so I also want to spend some time going through how to really conceptualize the joining process from a foundational level so you can effectively apply these concepts to a real usecase which we will also do here. Understanding these concepts early on will help you in your day to day job, and more imporantly learning how to check your work and understand what you are doing help you to make less mistakes.
