# **Manipulating Data in Dataframes**

In this lecture we will learn how to manipulate data in dataframes. You will need these techniques to accomplish some of the following tasks:

- Change data types when they are incorrectly interpretted;
- Clean your data;
- Create new columns;
- Rename columns;
- Extract or Create New Values.

We will also cover how to manipulate arrays in this lecture as well.

**OBS:** Youtube dataset is too large to push into github, so I'm not adding it. I do not have the kaggle link to dataset because it was downloaded from lecture's resources on udemy. But I think this `.csv` works as well. [Kaggle youtube dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new?select=CAvideos.csv)

**So let's get started!**
